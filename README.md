# Java-SmallLibraryManagerSystem
# This is a project from CSC331 course, Object-Oriented Programming.
# This is a small library manager of books, patrons, and loans.
# You can add a new book or patron. Patrons can borrow and return books. You can see the list of books by author name or by year from XXXX-XXXX, for example 1999-2002.
# Make sure to create a folder called Resources to place these files: books.txt, patrons.txt, and loans.txt along with their original files in case you somehow lose the contents of the txt files or something.
