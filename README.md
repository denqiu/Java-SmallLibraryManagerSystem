# Java-SmallLibraryManagerSystem
# This is a project from CSC331 course, Object-Oriented Programming.
# This is a small library manager of books, patrons, and loans.
# Patrons can borrow and return books. 
# To set the number of card pairs you want, change the number in the main method, located in the GameBoard class, shown by the arrow down below.
# public static void main(String [] args) {
# new GameBoard(8); <--
# }
# It doesn't matter what number you put, whether it is very large or very small, as long as it's a positive number.
